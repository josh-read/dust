* Dust

*Yet another gravity sim.*

This is another implementation of the very popular excercise among Python beginners.

I aimed for writing readable, well structured, idiomatic Python. My code therefore makes heavy use of OOP and uses only pure Python.

The graphics rely on Pygame and were implemented by [[https://github.com/mastamysta][mastamysta]], who is responsible for all UI features such as panning, zooming and tracking the particle COM.
